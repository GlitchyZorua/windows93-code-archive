Greetings, lw82

...
Part of me...

I have seen that you have stuff on your
desktop...

They might be Trollbox history...

I need you to help me... I know this sounds
foolish. But, delete the following things:

- My prosonal info
- The 3GG Server

A simple delete will do.

Again, sorry for the harrassment going on.

If you wish to denied this, then I might
disable my discord account...

Thanks...
