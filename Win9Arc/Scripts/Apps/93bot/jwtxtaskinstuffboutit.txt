Greetings, lw82 (your username) [ok]

...
Part of me... (...) [ok]

I have seen that you have stuff on your
desktop... 

They might be Trollbox history...

(you seem to have all the info for the trollbox, you know. ... the screen share? Yeah... i saw them) 

[yeah yeah, its just saved conversations from tt, idk why exactly i save all that thing, but i just save and maybe i ll need that someday 4 something idk, whatever, i just save that and idk exactly why, whatever whatever whatever]

I need you to help me... I know this sounds
foolish. But, delete the following things:

- My personal info
- The 3GG Server

(Ok, I wanted you to delete them cuz 1, I don't want anyone to see them, and 2, the 3GG     Server seems like a joke or a prank)
[as i said, its deleted, btw... dude... did u rlly think that ill share that thing? btw, 2day kayke asked me about how i got ur ip and stuff, and of course i didnt taught that 2 him, not even that, so rlx]

A simple delete will do.

Again, sorry for the harrassment going on.

(Meaning that i'm pretty crude for some reason, but i'm sorry, DON'T FREAK OUT OK?!)
[ok, this part u ll have 2 explain better, im confused here]

If you wish to denied this, then I might
disable my discord account...

(This will never happend)
[ok, this is gd 2 hear, i mean, i tought that if i didnt delete the stuff ya ll rlly delete ur account and stuff lol]

Thanks...
(...) [ok, lol]
