=============
This is a Windows 3.1 theme created by litevx for Windows 93.
Copy files in "boot" folder to /a/boot and reboot to install the theme.

This theme also includes additonal code to limit the screen size and replace the taskbar with a Program Manager.

If you would like to unlimit the screen size, delete Container.css.

You can remove Progman.js to disable the Program Manager, however the taskbar will still be hidden.
