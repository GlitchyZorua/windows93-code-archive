In Solitude, Yeah'ing 253 times will overflow the memory into address x00017C8A, which is where the "New" code is stored. You will want to resize the screen as small as it will go, then once you have Yeah'ed 253 times, bring it back to normal size. Do not click in where the yeah's are, they will crash Solitude. The cards that appear in the top stack will be code of "New" and part of it, along with the main pile, will be the "Retry" section. Once this is done, you will get a lot cards randomly placed (they will consistently show like this). You can drag the 5 of clubs above the blue card, and the blue card will move along with it. All the untextured cards are moveable, and can be dragged on any other untextured card. Drag each card from onto the the 4th pile on the top stack onto the first untextured card of the main pile until you reach a 4 of spades. Drag that up to the main stack in the first part, then drag the ace of hearts on the pink card from the main stack. Drag all untextured cards underneath that ace to another pile, and then press New. Nothing will appear to change as you overwrote it, but you can drag any card, including blue and pink cards, onto any other cards. This is because the code you made by dragging those cards set memory address 0x000005D to all 1's, which dictates which cards can be dragged and dropped. After this, you can execute any code by dragging cards into the top stack and by pressing "New".
